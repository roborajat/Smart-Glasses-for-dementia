# Smart Glasses for Dementia (Prototype)

This repository will evolve in phases:
1. **Project structure** (current step)
2. **Webcam prototype** (desktop/web app that detects faces and shows profile details)
3. **Glasses prototype** (hardware integration)

## Planned Architecture

```
Smart-Glasses-for-dementia/
├── backend/            # AI services (face detection/recognition, profile lookup)
├── frontend/           # UI for webcam preview + right-side details panel
├── data/               # Local data store for known people (profiles, embeddings)
├── docs/               # Design docs, diagrams, requirements
├── scripts/            # Setup, tooling, and dataset helpers
└── README.md
```

## Next Step (Step 2)

We'll define the initial webcam prototype requirements (tech stack and minimal UI) and add starter code.
